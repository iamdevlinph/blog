I'm Devlin Pajaron. A [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) Developer from the Philippines.

## Why JavaScript?
<hr class='divider--fade' />

AngularJS is what really got me into it. Because it looked cool - changing routes without the page refreshing.

But if we're just to talk about the fundamentals of JavaScript itself, I've just read the [Chapter 1 of You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/). Still a lot to read and learn.

Nonetheless, I've been learning JS Frameworks along the way such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), haven't started with [Angular 4](https://angular.io/) though. And next goal is mobile development: [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for React and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) for Angular.

## Me in the industry

### Work background

I'm currently an AngularJS Developer at [AsiaInspection](http://www.asiainspection.com/), my first company since graduating last April 2016.

### Any works to show?

I'm still on my first company with no other gigs, not really that much to show.

My [resume](https://resume.iamdevlinph.me/) would be a good start. My works are also listed there.

### Get in touch

If you have any gigs or opportunities, you can contact me through [iamdevlinph@gmail.com](mailto:iamdevlinph@gmail.com) or my skype at [live:devlinpajaron](skype:live:devlinpajaron?chat).

## About this blog
<hr class='divider--fade' />

My reason for starting something like this is to share some of my insights or maybe even snippets that helped me along the way, which may also help others.

Some goals:
* Integrate Disqus
* Publish my JavaScript Development environment on Windows using WSL
