If you're someone who better learns things through reading.<br/>
If you're someone who code or wants to learn how to code.

Then [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) is for you.

They offer [a free e-book everyday](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning).<br/>
That is 365 free e-books in a year. Some of which are quite pricey. So this offer is really hard to miss.

I'm not a much of a reader myself but I do time to time, and I have collected a bunch already.<br/>
Some of the titles I have:
<ul class="article_list">
    <li>D3.js By Example by Heydt</li>
    <li>Learning TypeScript by Jansen</li>
    <li>Mastering JavaScript High Performance by Adams</li>
    <li>MEAN Web Development by Haviv</li>
</ul>

These books do come again so always check out the page.

The offer resets everyday at 08:00AM GMT+8 (Philippine Time).
