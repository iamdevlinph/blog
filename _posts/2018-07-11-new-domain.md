I will be moving to a new domain.

I forgot the 2FA for my godaddy account and removing it is a hassle. So I'll just ditch my current domain and find another one.

I will update this post if I already have a new domain.

Stuff to change when using the new domain :(

* Disqus URL
* Google Webmasters
* Google Analytics
* Set-up URL stuff
