I'm currently on the process of rewriting my [resume](https://iamdevlinph.github.io/resume/)

Currently this is how it behaves.

![current resume responsive behaviour](/img/css-grid-in-action/current_resume_behaviour.gif)

This is just a template so I really can't explain how it works. All I care is that I liked the outcome ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

And this is how it behaves now using the CSS grid.

![using css grid](/img/css-grid-in-action/resume_in_css_grid.gif)

It's almost the same now. With a few lines of codes I was able to almost recreate it. I know, still needs some work, but I'll get there.

Being bad at CSS, CSS grids, somehow makes layouting a tad easier.

You can see the code in this [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/iamdevlinph/zytofwuj/)

What do you think of CSS grid? Share your thoughts in the comments!
